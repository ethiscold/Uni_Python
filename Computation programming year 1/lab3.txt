ECOR 1041 Lab 3 Solutions

Using a text editor, type your solutions to the exercises in the lab
instructions (file ECOR1041_Lab3.pdf) in the indicated areas.

===========
Exercise 1:

(a) Write the Python statement that caused the variable degrees_f to
appear in the memory model

==> degrees_F=70

(b) What is the name of the frame containing degrees_f?

==> Global Frame

(c) What does the arrow that points from degrees_f to 70 represent?

==> The value that the object is bound to

(d) Write the Python statement that caused the variable degrees_k to
appear in the memory model.

==> degrees_K = ((degrees_F-32) * (5/9))+273.15

(e) The arrow in degrees_k points to an object. What is the type and
value of this object?

==> The type is a float and the value is 294.2611

===========
Exercise 2:

Copy the four assignment statements from Python Tutor and paste them
between the two dashed lines.
--------------------------------
mpg=32
LITRES_PER_GALLON = 4.54609
KMS_PER_MILE = 1.60934
fuel_consumption = ( LITRES_PER_GALLON / (KMS_PER_MILE*mpg) ) * 100
--------------------------------

(a) What is the name of the first variable that appears in the
memory model? What is the type and value of the object that it refers to?

==> mpg. It is an int with a value of 32

(b) What is the name of the second variable that appears in the
memory model? What is the type and value of the object that it refers to?

==> LITERS_PER_GALLON. It is a float with a value of 4.5461

(c) What is the name of the third variable that appears in the
memory model? What is the type and value of the object that it refers to?

==> KMS_PER_MILE. It is a float with a value of 1.6093

(d) What is the name of the fourth variable that appears in the
memory model? What is the type and value of the object that it refers to?

==> fuel_consumption. It is a float with a value of 0.0882755

===========
Exercise 3:

Copy the five assignment statements from Python Tutor and paste them
between the two dashed lines.
--------------------------------
principal = 1500
rate = 0.043
n = 4
time = 6
amount = principal * (1 + (rate/n)) ** (n*time)
--------------------------------

===========
Exercise 4:

Write a short step-by-step explanation of how Python evaluates the
statement:

x *= x + x

when x is refers to 5.

- Python excecutes the right hand side of the equation first, ie x + x or 5+5 in this case
- Then python will evaluate the *= statement by multiplying the left side of the equation by the right side, ie x * (x+x) or 5*(5+5)
- Finally it sets x to the result. x=50
